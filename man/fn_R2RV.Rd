fn_R2RV(eq)

\item{eq}{Summary of the equation fitted}

\value{
R2RV The robust version of the coefficient of determination.
}
\description{
The function calculates a robust version of the coefficient of determination
R2RV using the equation Summary values fitted with the robustbase::nlrob() function.
}
\details{
This is the consistency corrected robust coefficient of determination by Renaud and Victoria-Feser (2010) which allows for a possible correction factor **a** for consistency considerations.

Inside the function:

  The vectors of observed (**y1**), predicted (**yc**) and weighted (**W**) values are obtained from the summary model (**eq**).

  The value of the Weighted Estimate Average (**ywea**), the  modified sum of squares for explained (**SSEw**), total (**SSTw**), and residual (**SSRw**) were estimated.

  The correction factor value for consistency considerations a for 95 percent was also obtained from summary model (eq).

  A vector with the robust version of the coefficient of determination **R2wa** and its adjusted value **R2wa_adj** were returned as a vector.
