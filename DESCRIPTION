Title: Morphological Relationships Fitted by Robust Regression 
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Hugo Aguirre-Villaseñor
Maintainer: Hugo Aguirre-Villaseñor <hugo.aguirre@inapesca.gob.mx>
Description: This is a methodological package developed in R to analyze the 
              submitted article by Aguirre-Villaseñor et al. (FISH13711). Many
              species are marketed through artisanal fishing in various commercial
              forms. However, there are currently no biometric relationships that
              allow for predicting live weight (the total weight of the fish)
              from the different categories of landed weight, such as fillet
              weight, gutted weight, or frozen weight.
              The functions included in the Morefi package enable the evaluation
              of length-length, weight-weight and length-weight biometric 
              relationships using data that exhibit high variability and do not 
              meet the assumptions necessary for adjustment via least squares.
              Given this variability, a robust regression method is employed for
              analysis. The "robustbase" package (version 0.99-2) was utilized to
              fit robust regression models, using the functions lmrob() for linear
              and nlrob() for non-linear regression.
