# Morphological relationships of bullseye puffer *Sphoeroides annulatus* and their potential use in fishery management

![Bullseye puffer *Sphoeroides annulatus* (Jenyns 1842).](https://github.com/Macrurido/Morefi/blob/master/images/S_annulatus.png){width=125%, height=125%}

## Introduction

The *Morefi* package: *Morphological Relationships Fitted by Robust Regression*.
It is a methodological package developed in R to analyze the submitted article:

Aguirre-Villaseñor, H., Morales-Bojórquez, E., Cisneros-Mata (FISH13711). Biometric
relationships as a fisheries management tool: A case study of the bullseye puffer
(*Sphoeroides annulatus*. Tetraodontidae). Fisheries Research.

The objective of this study is to provide quantitative data on some morphological
relationships to predict:

 (a) the biomass of different weight categories,
 (b) the fillet yield from body measurements and
 (c) the suitability of the fillet yield to be used as a management reference point for the bullseye puffer *Sphoeroides annulatus*.
    
For this, two exercises are proposed using 250 g of fillet (benchmark) as a 
reference: (i) how many organisms are required to obtain the benchmark by changing
the average length? (ii) taking into account that five is the maximum number of
organisms of a species allowed for recreational fishing per person per day, what
is the average size to reach the benchmark? 

## Tutorial objective

The goal of this tutorial is to replicate the analysis performed in the submitted
article Aguirre et al. (FISH13711) step by step, while explaining the functionality
of the [*Morefi* package *Morphological Relationships Fitted by Robust Regression*](https://github.com/Macrurido/Morefi),
developed in R. This package streamlines the methodology and improves the clarity
and impact of the results, as well as the graphical presentations, including 
personalized tables and figures.

## Instaling Morefi

The Morefi package includes functions that facilitate data analysis and ensure
reproducibility of results.For more information about the functions, please visit the [Morefi](https://macrurido.github.io/Morefi/) GitHub page.

To install this package from GitHub do the following from the R console:

```{r Morefi, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results="hide"}
if (!require("Morefi")){
        library(devtools)
        install_github("Macrurido/Morefi")
library(Morefi)        
} 
```

When Morefi is installed, it either updates the necessary package or installs it
if it is not already present.

<!-- En teoría si quito los que estan referenciados en Morefi debe de jalar,
Debo quitar todo lo referente a embellecer tablas, revisar que paquetes quedan y cuales no
-->

To make sure that all the necessary packages for this example are up to date,
they are defined in the packages vector. If a package is already installed,
it will be loaded; if not, it will be installed and then loaded.

```{r packages, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results="hide" }
packages <- c("broom", "dplyr","ggplot2", "ggtext", "glue",
              "investr", "kableExtra", "latex2exp", "Morefi",
              "patchwork", "purrr", "reshape2", "robustbase")

for (i in packages) {
  if (!require(i, character.only = TRUE)){
    install.packages(i, dependencies = TRUE)
    library(i, character.only = TRUE)
  }  # End if
} # End for
```

### theme_papers()

The `theme_papers` is created to standardize the graphic format, used as base 
`theme_bw`. The `theme_set()` function is used to apply the theme to all charts
automatically. It's not necessary to add `+ theme_papers()` after each ggplot snippet.

To call the `theme_papers()` function and automatically apply it to
all figures in this document, use the following statement:  


```{r theme_set, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results="hide"}
theme_papers <- Morefi::theme_papers()
theme_set(theme_papers)
```

### Data

In Morefi, the data utilized in Aguirre-Villaseñor et al. (Submitted) is incorporated.

In the file `Botete` there is the biometric data of the bullseye 
puffer *S. annulatus*, with the following variables, three lengths
(cm): total (LT), standard (LS) and body trunk (LB); and three weights
(g): total (WT); body trunk (WB) and fillet (Wfi). Additionally, there
is a categorical variable called 'Fleet' that distinguishes between
artisanal (fresh) and trawling (frozen-thawed), represented by the
values 1 and 2, respectively.

To access the data file, the data frame is stored in `mydata`.

```{r Botete, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
mydata <- Morefi::Botete
tmp <- mydata
str(tmp)
```

A second dataset, `Botete_land`, contains records of pufferfish catches landed 
along the Mexican Pacific coast in 2023, measured in kilograms (kg). It includes
information about the landed weight categorized as **landed**, as well as its 
conversion to live weight, referred to as **biomass**, for each landing 
presentation. The dataset outlines total weight (WT), body trunk weight (WB),
and fillet weight (Wfi). Additionally, it specifies whether the catch was fresh
or frozen-thawed. The dataset also includes the value of the landed catch in 
Mexican pesos (**Pesos $**) and the value per kilogram of landed weight
(**Pesos_kg**) (SIPESCA, 2024).

To access the data file, the data frame is stored in `catch`.

```{r catch, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
catch <- Morefi::Botete_land
catch
```

## Metodology

### Defining the models

Eight relationships are fitted, six to a simple linear model: LT vs LS, LT vs LB,
LS vs LB, WT vs WB, WT vs Wfi, WB vs Wfi; and three to a potential model:
LT vs WT, LT vs WB, LT vs Wfi.

To perform each regression, a list named `modelos` is created to specify the 
variables that will be included. These variables are then stored in a vector.

```{r modelos, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results="hide"}
modelos <- list (LTvs.LS  =  c(1,2),
                 LTvs.LB  =  c(1,3),
                 LSvs.LB  =  c(2,3),
                 WTvs.WB  =  c(4,5),
                 WTvs.Wfi =  c(4,6),
                 WBvs.Wfi =  c(5,6),
                 LTvs.WT  =  c(1,4),
                 LTvs.WB  =  c(1,5),
                 LTvs.Wfi =  c(1,6))
```

### Labellers

The labelers designated for use in this script are outlined below.

#### Model labelers

For the model labelers, the parameters include subscripts, and the customized
labels for the plots are stored in the variable `my_labeller`.

```{r my_labeller, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results="hide"}

my_labeller <- as_labeller(c(LT_LS=  "L[T]-L[S]",
                             LT_LB=  "L[T]-L[B]",
                             LS_LB=  "L[S]-L[B]",
                             WT_WB=  "W[T]-W[B]",
                             WT_Wfi= "W[T]-W[fi]",
                             WB_Wfi= "W[B]-W[fi]",
                             LT_WT=  "L[T]-W[T]",
                             LT_WB=  "L[T]-W[B]",
                             LT_Wfi= "L[T]-W[fi]"),
                           default = label_parsed)
```

#### Variable labelers for the plots.

For the variable labelers, the variables include subscripts, and the customized
labels for the plots are stored in the variable `my_labeller`.

```{r}
my_labeller2 <- as_labeller(c(LT=  "L[T]",
                             LS=  "L[S]",
                             LB=  "L[B]",
                             WT=  "W[T]x",
                             WB=  "W[B]",
                             Wfi= "W[fi]"),
                             default = label_parsed)
```

#### Variable labelers for the tables.

The 'row_name' holds labels for the models used in the tables, which will 
replace the current values in the 'Models' column of the data frame for the table
design. Defining model labels using subscript characters for the tables.

```{r row_name}
# Defining model labels using subscript characters for the tables.
row_name <- c("$L_T$ vs. $L_S$", "$L_T$ vs. $L_B$",
              "$L_S$ vs. $L_B$", "$W_T$ vs. $W_B$",
              "$W_T$ vs. $W_fi$", "$W_B$ vs. $W_fi$",
              "$L_T$ vs. $W_T$", "$L_T$ vs. $W_B$",
              "$L_T$ vs. $W_T$")
```

### Regression results.

**Empty tables and lists to fill, throughout the cycles.**

To organize and present the results of the regression analysis, several tables
were created based on `List_base`.

To store the results for each model from every data source, nested lists were 
developed. This structure allows for a hierarchical or multi-level organization
of the data. At the first level, the datasets are categorized into three groups:
Fresh, Frozen-thawed (Frozen), and Total sample (Total). At the second level,
sub-lists provide the results from various fitted models `model_list`.

The number of items in a list and their names depend on the fitted model of
*x against y*.


```{r List_base, }
# Create empty model list  
model_list <- setNames(lapply(names(modelos), function(x) NULL), names(modelos))

List_base <- list("Fresh"= model_list,
                  "Frozen"= model_list,
                  "Total" = model_list)
```

Using `List_base`

#### Summary Regression Table.

To store the summary regression, a customised table `T1` is generated. The type
of function model (**Linear** or **Potential**), and its variables, are
indicated in the first two columns. The third column indicates the data source
used (**Fresh**, **Fresh-Thawed**, or **Total**). By row it is stored: the
**Intercept**, its confidence interval **(CI95%)**; the **Slope**;  its
**(CI95%)**; the adjusted robust coefficient of determination **R2,adj,w,a** 
and the degrees of freedom **DF**.

```{r T1, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
    # An empty table to save summary regression results   
 
T1 <- data.frame(matrix(NA, nrow = 3, ncol = 9))
names(T1) <- c("Function", "Model","Categories",
               "Intercept", "CI95%","Slope",
               "CI95%", "R2","DF")
T1
```       

To store the results of each fitted model, a list called `List_Tables` was created.
Each item in the list contains the customized table `T1`, which is initially 
filled with `NA` values.

```{r List_Tables, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

# Create model list including empty T1 table
T1_model_list <- setNames(lapply(1:length(modelos), function(x)
T1),names(modelos))

#List_Tables <- list("Fresh"= T1_model_list,
#                    "Frozen"= T1_model_list,
#                    "Total" = T1_model_list)
List_Tables <- T1_model_list

```

#### Coincident Curves Test Table. 

List_TCCT store the values and calculus for the Coincident Curves Test

To store the results of each model regressions, an empty matrix of 4 rows and 8 
columns are created. The table `CCT` stores the values and calculus for the 
Coincident Curves Test between weight categories: **Fresh**, **Frozen**, 
**Total** and **Joined** (sum of values of **Fresh**, **Frozen**): the residual
sum of squares **RSS**, degree of freedom **DF**, Analysis of the Residual Sum 
of Squares **ARSS**,  **F-table**, **p-value** and decision criteria for 
$\alpha$= 0.05 **Criteria**. 

To store the results of each fitted model, a list called `List_TCCT` was created.
Each item in the list contains the customized table `CCT`, which is initially 
filled with `NA` values.

```{r List_TCCT, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results="hide"}
catego <- c("Fresh","Frozen","Total")

nrow <- length(catego)+1
            
CCT <- (matrix(NA,nrow=nrow,ncol=8))
CCT[,2] <-  c(catego,"Joined")
colnames(CCT) <- c("Model","Data","RSS","DF","ARSS","F-table",
                   "p-value","Criteria")

# Create model list including empty T1 table
List_TCCT <- setNames(lapply(1:length(modelos), function(x)
CCT),names(modelos))

CCT
```
####

### Regression results 

The figure list `List_Figures` is stored in a list for each category: 1) fresh;
2) frozen-thawed and 3) total. 

For each category list, the elements are named using the vectors values of 
`X_names`: L~T~ *vs.* L~S~, L~T~ *vs.* L~B~, L~S~ *vs.* L~B~, W~T~ *vs.* W~B~,
W~T~ *vs.* W~fi~, W~B~ *vs.* W~fi~, L~T~ *vs.* W~T~, L~T~ *vs.* W~B~, L~T~ *vs.* W~fi~)

The `List_wi` store the the weighted values $w_i$ from each model.

### List_dfa_long

For each landed category, the data frames in `List_fit` were transformed into long-form data frames and stored in List_fit_long.

```{r X_names, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results="hide"}
          
X_list <- vector(mode='list', length=length(modelos))
         
X_names <- c("LT_LS",
             "LT_LB",
             "LS_LB",
             "WT_WB",
             "WT_Wfi",
             "WB_Wfi",
             "LT_WT",
             "LT_WB",
             "LT_Wfi")
names(X_list) <- X_names 
```
