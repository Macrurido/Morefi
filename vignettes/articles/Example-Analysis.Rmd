# Morphological relationships of bullseye puffer *Sphoeroides annulatus* and their potential use in fishery management

![Bullseye puffer *Sphoeroides annulatus* (Jenyns 1842).](https://github.com/Macrurido/Morefi/blob/master/vignettes/images/S_annulatus.png){width=125%, height=125%}

## Introduction

The *Morefi* package: *Morphological Relationships Fitted by Robust Regression*.
It is a methodological package developed in R to analyze the submitted article:

Aguirre-Villaseñor, H., Morales-Bojórquez, E., Cisneros-Mata (FISH13711). Biometric
relationships as a fisheries management tool: A case study of the bullseye puffer
(*Sphoeroides annulatus*. Tetraodontidae). Fisheries Research.

The objective of this study is to provide quantitative data on some morphological
relationships to predict:

 (a) the biomass of different weight categories,
 (b) the fillet yield from body measurements and
 (c) the suitability of the fillet yield to be used as a management reference point for the bullseye puffer *Sphoeroides annulatus*.
    
For this, two exercises are proposed using 250 g of fillet (benchmark) as a 
reference: (i) how many organisms are required to obtain the benchmark by changing
the average length? (ii) taking into account that five is the maximum number of
organisms of a species allowed for recreational fishing per person per day, what
is the average size to reach the benchmark? 

## Tutorial objective

The goal of this tutorial is to replicate the analysis performed in the submitted
article Aguirre et al. (FISH13711) step by step, while explaining the functionality
of the [*Morefi* package *Morphological Relationships Fitted by Robust Regression*](https://github.com/Macrurido/Morefi),
developed in R. This package streamlines the methodology and improves the clarity
and impact of the results, as well as the graphical presentations, including 
personalized tables and figures.

## Instaling Morefi

The Morefi package includes functions that facilitate data analysis and ensure
reproducibility of results.For more information about the functions, please visit the [Morefi](https://macrurido.github.io/Morefi/) GitHub page.

To install this package from GitHub do the following from the R console:

```{r Morefi, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results="hide"}
if (!require("Morefi")){
        library(devtools)
        install_github("Macrurido/Morefi")
library(Morefi)        
} 
```

When Morefi is installed, it either updates the necessary package or installs it
if it is not already present.

<!-- En teoría si quito los que estan referenciados en Morefi debe de jalar,
Debo quitar todo lo referente a embellecer tablas, revisar que paquetes quedan y cuales no
-->

To make sure that all the necessary packages for this example are up to date,
they are defined in the packages vector. If a package is already installed,
it will be loaded; if not, it will be installed and then loaded.

```{r packages, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results="hide" }
packages <- c("broom", "dplyr","ggplot2", "ggtext", "glue",
              "investr", "kableExtra", "latex2exp", "Morefi",
              "patchwork", "purrr", "reshape2", "robustbase")

for (i in packages) {
  if (!require(i, character.only = TRUE)){
    install.packages(i, dependencies = TRUE)
    library(i, character.only = TRUE)
  }  # End if
} # End for
```

## theme_papers()

The `theme_papers` is created to standardize the graphic format, used as base 
`theme_bw`. The `theme_set()` function is used to apply the theme to all charts
automatically. It's not necessary to add `+ theme_papers()` after each ggplot snippet.

To call the `theme_papers()` function and automatically apply it to
all figures in this document, use the following statement:  


```{r theme_set, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results="hide"}
theme_papers <- Morefi::theme_papers()
theme_set(theme_papers)
```

### Data

In the file `Botete.rda` there is the biometric data of the bullseye 
puffer *S. annulatus*, with the following variables, three lengths
(cm): total (LT), standard (LS) and body trunk (LB); and three weights
(g): total (WT); body trunk (WB) and fillet (Wfi). Additionally, there
is a categorical variable called 'Fleet' that distinguishes between
artisanal (fresh) and trawling (frozen-thawed), represented by the
values 1 and 2, respectively.

To access the data file, the data frame is stored in `mydata`.

```{r Botete, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
mydata <- Morefi::Botete
tmp <- mydata
str(tmp)
```

A second dataset, `Botete_land.rda`, contains records of pufferfish catches landed along the Mexican Pacific coast in 2023, measured in kilograms (kg). It includes information about the landed weight categorized as **landed**, as well as its conversion to live weight, referred to as **biomass**, for each landing presentation. The dataset outlines total weight (WT), body trunk weight (WB), and fillet weight (Wfi). Additionally, it specifies whether the catch was fresh or frozen-thawed. The dataset also includes the value of the landed catch in Mexican pesos (**Pesos $**) and the value per kilogram of landed weight (**Pesos_kg**) (SIPESCA, 2024).

To access the data file, the data frame is stored in `catch`.

```{r catch, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
catch <- Morefi::Botete_land
catch
```
