This is a methodological package developed in R for analyzing the submitted article:

Aguirre-Villaseñor, H., Morales-Bojórquez, E., Cisneros-Mata (FISH13711). Biometric
relationships as a fisheries management tool: A case study of the bullseye puffer
(*Sphoeroides annulatus*. Tetraodontidae). Fisheries Research.

In fisheries monitoring, body length is the most commonly measured parameter because
it is quick and easy to obtain. In contrast, measuring weight requires a level 
and stable scale, which can be difficult to secure in field sampling. Biometric
relationships are crucial in fisheries biology. When accurately calculated, 
these relationships can be very useful for management purposes, especially for 
estimating an organism's total length or weight based on other body measurements.

Many species are marketed through artisanal fishing in various commercial forms.
However, there are currently no biometric relationships that allow for predicting
live weight (the total weight of the fish) from the different categories of landed
weight, such as fillet weight, gutted weight, or frozen weight.

The objective of this package is to provide quantitative analysis for various 
morphological relationships that help predict: a) the expected live weight of
different landed weight categories, b) the expected fillet yield from various 
commercial presentations, and c) testing the suitability of fillet yield as a 
reference point in managing the target species.

For this purpose, some functions and a vignette were created to explain the process
step by step. Its implementation streamlines the methodology and enhances the 
clarity and impact of both the results and graphical presentations (tables and 
figures are personalized).

The functions included in the Morefi package enable the
evaluation of length-length, weight-weight and length-weight
biometric relationships using data that exhibit high
variability and do not meet the assumptions necessary for
adjustment via 
least squares. Given this variability, a robust regression method is employed 
for analysis. The "robustbase" package (version 0.99-2) was utilized to fit 
robust regression models, using the functions lmrob() for linear and nlrob()
for non-linear regression (Maechler *et al*., 2024).

# Installation

You can install the development version of Morefi from [GitHub](https://github.com/Macrurido/Morefi.git) 
using one of the following options:

Using the **pak** package
``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("Macrurido/Morefi")
```
or using the **devtools** package

``` r
library(devtools)
install_github("Macrurido/Morefi")
```
# Data available in the package{.tabset}

To showcase the functionality of the Morefi package, the two data sets
from Aguirre-Villaseñor *et al*. (Submitted) are included.

## Bullseye puffer measures

To demonstrate how the package functions, we utilize the dataset `botete`,
containing 1,397 fish across 7 variables: the total length(LT), standard length
(SL), body trunk length (LB), total weight (WT), body trunk weight (WB), and 
fillet weight (Wfi) of the bullseye puffer (*Sphoeroides annulatus*), collected 
from the Eastern Central Pacific. In this dataset, the landing category is 
included in the "Fleet" variable, which is categorized as follows: 1 indicates 
Fresh, while 2 denotes Frozen-thawed. 

To access the data file, the data frame is stored in an object, such as 'mydata'.

```{r mydata, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
mydata <- Morefi::Botete
str(mydata)
```

## Bullseye puffer fish landings

A second dataset `Botete_land`, provided the Mexican fishing records of bullseye
puffer landed on the Pacific coast in 2023 and their live weight corresponding
live weight for each weight category (kg): total (WT), body trunk (WB) or fillet
(Wfi), either Fresh or Frozen-thawed (SIPESCA, 2024).

To access the data file, the data frame is stored in `catch`.

```{r catch, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
catch <- Morefi::Botete_land
catch
```

# theme_papers()

The `theme_papers()` is created to standardize the graphic format,
used as base `theme_bw()`. To showcase their design, this manual
presents graphics in both their original format and the format created
using the `theme_papers()`.

To call the `theme_papers()` function use the following statement:

```{r theme_set, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results="hide"}
theme_papers <- Morefi::theme_papers()
```

# Lists and tables to organize and store results
## Lists to store summaries

Lists must be created to store the relevant summaries. To organize the regression results, a nested list structure is used. This design allows for a hierarchical or multi-level data organization. At the first level, models are categorized, while the second level categorizes the datasets into Fresh, Frozen-thawed (Frozen), and Total sample (Total). Finally, at the third level, sub-lists contain the results from the various fitted models.

```{r list, }
# First hierarchical level: Models
    X_list <- vector(mode='list', length=2)
    X_names <- c("LT_LS", "LT_WT")
    names(X_list) <- X_names 
# Second hierarchical level: Category
    Fresh <- X_list
    Frozen <- X_list
    Total <- X_list
# Third hierarchical level: 
    List_fit <- list(Fresh,Frozen,Total) # Fitting results
    List_ICmodels <- List_fit # Confidence interval of the models. 
```

## List to store Coincident Curves Test Tables. 

To store the results of each model regressions, an empty matrix of 4 rows and 8 
columns are created. The table `CCT` stores the values and calculus for the 
Coincident Curves Test between weight categories: **Fresh**, **Frozen**, 
**Total** and **Joined** (sum of values of **Fresh**, **Frozen**): the residual
sum of squares **RSS**, degree of freedom **DF**, Analysis of the Residual Sum 
of Squares **ARSS**,  **F-table**, **p-value** and decision criteria for 
$\alpha$= 0.05 **Criteria**. 

To store the results of each fitted model, a list called `List_TCCT` was created.
Each item in the list contains the customized table `CCT`, which is initially 
filled with `NA` values.

```{r List_TCCT, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results="hide"}
             
#CCT <- (matrix(NA,nrow=4,ncol=8))
#CCT[,2] <-  c("Fresh","Frozen","Total","Joined")
#colnames(CCT) <- c("Model","Data","RSS","DF","ARSS","F-table",
 #                  "p-value","Criteria")

# Create model list including empty T1 table
#List_TCCT <- setNames(lapply(1:length(modelos), function(x)
#CCT),names(modelos))

#CCT
```

## List to store summary regression tables.

To store the summary regression, a customised table `T1` is generated. The type
of function model (**Linear** or **Potential**), and its variables, are
indicated in the first two columns. The third column indicates the data source
used (**Fresh**, **Fresh-Thawed**, or **Total**). By row it is stored: the
**Intercept**, its confidence interval **(CI95%)**; the **Slope**;  its
**(CI95%)**; the adjusted robust coefficient of determination **R2,adj,w,a** 
and the degrees of freedom **DF**.

```{r T1, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
    # An empty table to store the summary regression results   
 
T1 <- data.frame(matrix(NA, nrow = 3, ncol = 9))
names(T1) <- c("Function", "Model","Categories",
               "Intercept", "CI95%","Slope",
               "CI95%", "R2","DF")
# Create model list including empty T1 table
#List_Tables <- setNames(lapply(1:length(modelos), function(x)
#T1),names(modelos))

#T1
```     

## xseq

A list called "x_seq" was created to store the sequences of
independent variables used in various models, including Total Length,
Standard Length, Total Weight, and Body Trunk Weight. For each model,
the minimum and maximum values, as well as the bin range for each
sequence, have been established.
    
```{r}
List_x_seq <- list(LT= seq(5,45,by=1),LS= seq(5,40,by=1), WT= seq(50,2250,by=10), WB= seq(0,1000,by=10))
```

# Fitting modeles

Using the biometric data from `Morefi::botete`, a linear relationship
between Total Length and Standard Length (LT_LS) was established using
the `robustbase::lmrob` function. Additionally, the relationship
between Total Length and Total Weight (LT_WT) was fitted using the
`robustbase::nlm` function, with an input value of a = 0.1 and a
slope of b = 3.

Both relationships are fitted for the landed categories: Fresh, Frozen-thawed (Frozen), Total (All samples).

In the for loop, the jth landed categories is selected: 1 for  Fresh, 2 for Frozen-thawed, 3 for the total sample.

```{r fitting, }
#for (j in 1:3) {
#      if (j <3)  {
#            tmp <- mydata[mydata$Fleet == j,]
#            df <- dplyr::tibble(x1 = tmp[,1],y1 = tmp[,2])
            # Fitting model
#            eq <- robustbase::lmrob(y1 ~ x1, data= df,
 #                                    setting = "KS2014",
#                                     doCov = TRUE)
            # Storing values
            # Estimate confidence interval function
    #      List_ICmodels[[j]][[1]] <- Morefi::fn_intervals(eq,xseq)
     #     List_fit [[j]][[1]] <- fn_dfa(eq= eq) 
            
            
                
                
                
                
 #       }else{
  #              tmp <- mydata
   #   } # End if
  
    #  df <- dplyr::tibble(x1 = tmp[,1],
     #           y1 = tmp[,2])

#eq1 <- robustbase::lmrob(y1 ~ x1, data= df,
#                                  setting = "KS2014",
#                                              doCov = TRUE)





#  Power Model
#df <- dplyr::tibble(x1 = tmp[,1],
 #               y1 = tmp[,4])

#a=0.01
#b=3

#eq2 <- robustbase::nlrob(y1 ~ a*x1^b, data= df,
#                        start = list(a= a, b= b),
 #                       trace = FALSE)

  
  
  
  
        # In the for loop, the ith model is selected.

    
   # Linnear equation
#          eq <- robustbase::lmrob(y1 ~ x1, data= datos,
#                                  setting = "KS2014",
#                                              doCov = TRUE)
    # R squared
 #         R2 <- summary(eq)$r.squared    
          #Non parametric IC 95 for parameters
  #        betas_IC95 <- confint(eq, level = 0.95)

  #    }
          
```


The Total length (LT) - Total weight (WT) was estimated for the bullseye puffer
*Sphoeroides annulatus* for landed categories: Fresh, Frozen-thawed (Frozen), Total
(All sample) and Joined (sum of values of Fresh and Frozen). The Residual Sum of
Squares (RSS) and the degrees of freedom (DF) are provided for each data source.







# Morefi functions

The Morefi package includes functions that facilitate data analysis
and ensure reproducibility of results.

## fn_ARSS()

The function `fn_ARSS()` perform the Coincident Curves Test, to determine if there
are significant differences between the fitted curves for each database. It is 
based on the Analysis of the Residual Sum of Squares (ARSS) (Chen et al. 1992).


$$F=\frac{\frac{RSS_{p}-RSS_{s}}{3\bullet \left( K-1 \right)}}{\frac{RSS_{s}}{N-3\bullet K}}$$

$RSS_{p}= RSS$ of each regression fitted by pooled data, $RSS_{s}$= sum of the 
$RSS$ of each regression fitted for each individual sample, $N$= total sample 
size, and $K$ = number of samples in the comparison.

The residual sum of squares $RSS$ and the degrees of freedom $DF$ for each 
fitted regression are previously stored in the `List_TCCT` list. For each 
regression, the calculations are stored in a data frame `T1`, which is stored
iteratively using a loop for in a list `T`.

Inside the function, the RSS and DF for the joined sample are calculated to 
perform the F test for two tails $\alpha/2$. The decision criteria is performed:
"*" if $p-value\le \alpha$ or "NS" if the $p-val\gt \alpha$.

The function requires defining:

 * `List_TCCT`: A list with fitted regression results.  
 * `i`:  An integer value indicating the ith regression analyzed.
 * `alfa`: A numerical value that defines the significance level. The default number is 0.05.

The function return a data frame containing the results of the 
Coincident Curves Test stored in a list.

### Example

The Total length (LT) - Total weight (WT) was estimated for the bullseye puffer *Sphoeroides annulatus* for landed categories: Fresh, Frozen-thawed (Frozen), Total (All sample) and Joined (sum of values of Fresh and Frozen). The Residual Sum of Squares (RSS) and the degrees of freedom (DF) are provided for each data source. In the table the first row displays the Analysis of Residual Sum of Squares (ARSS), the p-value (p), and the decision criteria for the ARSS test (Criteria).

In the table the first row displays the Analysis of Residual Sum of Squares (ARSS),
the p-value (p), and the decision criteria for the ARSS test (Criteria). 

The adjusted models show the following data: Fresh SSR=   and DF= 742; Frozen 
SSR= 1280131.81 and DF= 651; and the total sample SSR= 6115874.53 and DF= 1395.
Values are stored in the table `Table_CC`, this is stored in a list, and the name
of each item is built with the acronyms of the model variables (e.g. LTWT).

```{r fn_ARSS, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results='asis'}
Table_CC <- data.frame(matrix(NA,nrow=4,ncol=8))
Table_CC[1,1] <- "Lt-WT" 
Table_CC[,2] <- c("Fresh","Frozen","Total","Joined")
colnames(Table_CC) <- c("Model","Category","RSS","DF","ARSS","F-table","p-value","Criteria")

Table_CC[1,3] <- 4424418.33
Table_CC[1,4] <-  742 
Table_CC[2,3] <- 1280131.81
Table_CC[2,4] <-  651 
Table_CC[3,3] <- 6115874.53
Table_CC[3,4] <-  1395 

List_ARSS <- list(LTWT=Table_CC)

i <- 1

ARSS <- fn_ARSS(List_ARSS, i,  alfa= 0.05)

```

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(knitr)
kable(ARSS[[i]], format = "html", caption = "Table of the Coincident Curve Test.")
```

## fn_dfa()

This function uses the `augment()` function from the `broom` package
to extract the observed values of the independent variable (x) and dependent
variable (y), along with the weights (wi), fitted values (fitt), and residuals
(ei) from the summary of the fitted model. It then turns these components
into tidy tibbles.

The function `augment()` does not provide the weights column for the `lmrob()`
function. The function `fn_dfa()` contains a conditional statement that
includes this variable in the output data frame of the linear adjustments.

In order to homogenizes the results, the columns names were renamed as "y",
"wi","x","fitt",and "ei".

An additional column has been included that codes errors using a scale based
on weighted values: unweighted (u), weighted (w), and outliers (o)
`dfa$scale <- ifelse(df$wi < 0.25, "o", ifelse(df$wi<1, "w", "u"))`.

The function requires defining:

 * `eq`: Summary of the equation fitted.  
 
### Example

Using the biometric data from `Morefi::botete`, a linear relationship
between Total Length and Standard Length (LT_LS) was established using
the `robustbase::lmrob` function. Additionally, the relationship
between Total Length and Total Weight (LT_WT) was fitted using the
`robustbase::nlm` function, with an input y-value of a = 0.1 and a
slope of b = 3.

For optimal functionality of `fn_dfa()`, the data frames used for fitting
relationships must be formatted as tibble.

```{r fn_dfa, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results='asis'}
library(dplyr)
library(tibble)

df <- dplyr::tibble(x1 = mydata[,1],
                y1 = mydata[,2])

eq1 <- robustbase::lmrob(y1 ~ x1, data= df,
                                  setting = "KS2014",
                                              doCov = TRUE)
dfa1 <- fn_dfa(eq= eq1)

#  Power Model
df <- dplyr::tibble(x1 = mydata[,1],
                y1 = mydata[,4])

a=0.01
b=3

eq2 <- robustbase::nlrob(y1 ~ a*x1^b, data= df,
                        start = list(a= a, b= b),
                        trace = FALSE)

dfa2 <- fn_dfa(eq= eq2)
```


```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
kable(dfa1[1:6,], format = "html", caption = "The first six rows of the table are displayed, based on the LT versus LS relationship results.")

kable(dfa2[1:6,], format = "html", caption = "The first six rows of the table are displayed, based on the LT versus WT relationship results.")
```


<!-- ### fn_fig_cs() -->

<!-- This function creates an individual plot displaying the fitted model -->
<!-- alongside the observed values, which are colored according to a weighted color scale. -->

<!-- The function requires defining: -->

<!--  * `df` A data frame contains the following variables: independent (x) and dependent (y) variables, the fitted variable (fitt), a weighted variable (wi), and additional details including the weights (wi), fitted values (fitt), residuals (ei), and the scale.  -->
<!--  * `opacity` A numeric value for the alpha aesthetic used to control the transparency of elements in a plot. -->

<!--  * `modelos` A list of variables that are used for the regression model. -->
<!--  * `i` An integer value indicating the regression analyzed. -->

<!-- The function return an individual plots for fitted models with a point color scale. -->

## fn_fig_e()

The function creates a graph that displays residuals on the vertical axis and 
either the independent variable or predicted values on the horizontal axis, as
determined by the researcher. The residuals are color-coded using a weighted scale.

The function returns a customized multi-panel residual plot that uses a color scale for the residual points.

Since the parameters contain subscripts, the labels were customized 
using the `ggplot2::as_labeller()` function and are stored in
`my_labeller`.

The function requires defining:

 * `df` A data frame contains the following variables: independent (x) and dependent (y) variables, the fitted variable (fitt), a weighted variable (wi), and additional details including the weights (wi), fitted values (fitt), residuals (ei), and the scale.
 * `opacity` A numeric value for the alpha aesthetic used to control the transparency of elements in a plot.
 * `tint` A vector that specifies the palette colors used to color the points.
 * `scale` A numeric vector that defines the thresholds for coloring the points.
 * `order` A vector determines the sequence of the plots.
 * `my_labeller` Transforms objects to labeller functions. Used internally by labeller().

### Example

A residual analysis of the model fitting has been conducted using
combined data sets for the pufferfish *Sphoeroides annulatus*. The
label in the grey box indicates the variables used for each model; the
first variable listed is the independent variable, and the second is
the dependent variable. The x-axis represents the values of the
independent variable, while the y-axis displays the raw residuals (ei).

The observed data points were coloured based on a weighted scale
$(w_{i})$: blue for unweighted $(w_{i}=1)$, green for weighted
$(1>w_{i}≥0.25)$, and black for outliers $(w_{i}<0.25)$. Lengths in cm
and weights in g.

The attributes associated with this function: `df`, `opacity`, `tint`, `wi_scale`, `X_names`, and `my_labeller` were defined in the section titled **Establishing Values for the Examples Provided.**

The objects `dfa1`, and `dfa2` were derived from the `fn_dfa()` example.

                           default = label_parsed)

# The plot
p <- fn_fig_e(df, opacity, tint, scale= wi_scale,
              order= X_names, my_labeller)
p + theme_papers
```

## fn_fig_fw()

`fn_fig_fw()`: The fitted values of the models for a landed
presentation category were displayed as a multi-panel plot. The
observed data points for each fitted relationship were categorized
according to a weighted color scale.

The function returns a customized multi-panel fitted values plot that
uses a color scale for the residual points.

Since the parameters contain subscripts, the labels were customized 
using the `ggplot2::as_labeller()` function and are stored in
`my_labeller`.

The function requires defining:

 * `df` A data frame contains the following variables: independent (x) and dependent (y) variables, the fitted variable (fitt), a weighted variable (wi), and additional details including the weights (wi), fitted values (fitt), residuals (ei), and the scale.
 * `opacity` A numeric value for the alpha aesthetic used to control the transparency of elements in a plot.
 * `tint` A vector that specifies the palette colors used to color the points.
 * `scale` A numeric vector that defines the thresholds for coloring the points.
 * `order` A vector determines the sequence of the plots.
 * `my_labeller` Transforms objects to labeller functions. Used internally by labeller().

## fn_fig_w()

`fn_fig_w()`: The residual structure was analyzed by graphing  
residuals against weighted values. A custom multi-panel plot
illustrates the structure of each fitted relationship,
categorized by a color-weighted scale of values.

Since the parameters contain subscripts, the labels were customized 
using the `ggplot2::as_labeller()` function and are stored in
`my_labeller`.

The function requires defining:

 * `df` A data frame contains the following variables: independent (x) and dependent (y) variables, the fitted variable (fitt), a weighted variable (wi), and additional details including the weights (wi), fitted values (fitt), residuals (ei), and the scale.
 * `opacity` A numeric value for the alpha aesthetic used to control the transparency of elements in a plot.
 * `tint` A vector that specifies the palette colors used to color the points.
 * `scale` A numeric vector that defines the thresholds for coloring the points.
 * `order` A vector determines the sequence of the plots.
 * `my_labeller` Transforms objects to labeller functions. Used internally by labeller().

### Example

The Residual Structures classified by a Weighted Scale was 
analyzed using combined data sets for the pufferfish
*Sphoeroides annulatus*. The label in the grey box indicates
the variables used for each model; the raw residuals are shown
on the x-axis, and the weighted residuals (wi) are displayed
on the y-axis.

The observed data points were coloured based on a weighted scale
$(w_{i})$: blue for unweighted $(w_{i}=1)$, green for weighted
$(1>w_{i}≥0.25)$, and black for outliers $(w_{i}<0.25)$. Lengths in cm
and weights in g.

The attributes associated with this function: `df`, `opacity`, `tint`, `wi_scale`, `X_names`, and `my_labeller` were previously defined in the section titled **Establishing Values for the Examples Provided.**

The objects `dfa1`, and `dfa2` were derived from the `fn_dfa()` example.

```{r}
# Preparing the dataset.
library(dplyr)
# The data
tmp1 <- dfa1              # Data frame 1
tmp1['id'] = "LT_LS"      # to add an ID column to a Data frame

tmp2 <- dfa2              # Data frame 2
tmp2['id'] = "LT_WT"      # to add an ID column to a Data Frame

df <- rbind(tmp1, tmp2)   # Joining data sets

# Establishing values for the examples provided
tint <- c("#000000", "#009E73", "#56B4E9")
opacity <- 0.7

# weighted value scale
wi_scale <- c(0.000, 0.249, 0.990, 1.000)

# To order facet wrap plots in ggplot2
X_names <- c("LT_LS", "LT_WT")

# The labels in the ggplot composite chart are customized to include subscripts.
library(ggplot2)
my_labeller <- as_labeller(c(LT_LS=  "L[T]-L[S]",
                             LT_WT=  "L[T]-W[T]"),
                           default = label_parsed)

# The plot
p <- fn_fig_w(df, opacity,tint, my_labeller,order= X_names) 

p + theme_papers
```

## `fn_freq()`

It is used as an internal function within `fn_freqw()`.

The `fn_freq()` function calculates a frequency distribution of data
using the `cut()` and `table()` functions from the R base. It produces a data frame that displays frequencies categorized by class interval.

Within the function, the non-cumulative absolute frequency is calculated for each user-defined class interval based on the `breaks` object. The `breaks` object must be defined outside the function by the user.

The attributes and examples of `fn_freq()` are detailed in the documentation for the `fn_freqw()` function below.

**See also** `cut()` and `table()` from the R base package.

## fn_freqw()

`fn_freqw()` calculate the percentage frequencies of weights by model
adjusted using the robust regression approach. The function calculates
the relative frequency distribution using the function `fn_freq()` from `Morefi` package. It returns a table with frequencies by class interval.

The breaks object must be defined. To incorporate the number of non-weighted values $(w_{i}=1)$, a class interval "1" is added to the sequence inside the function.

The function requires defining:

 * `df` A vector of data values. 
 * `breaks` A vector with class intervals.
 * `right` Logical, indicating if the intervals should be closed on the right (and open on the left) or vice versa.

**See also** `Morefi::fn_freq`; `cut()` and `table()` from the R base package.

### Example

The weighted values were obtained from the summary of linear and power
models fitted using robust regression and stored in `dfa1` and `dfa2`,
which were generated with the `fn_dfa()` example. In each data frame,
the weighted values are stored in the column labeled "wi."

The function `fn_freqw()` calculates the frequency of weighted values
within a defined interval based on a weighted scale classification:
unweighted $(w_{i}=1)$, weighted $(1>w_{i}≥0.25)$, and outliers
$(w_{i}<0.25)$. The weighted scale is stored in `breaks`.

```{r fn_freqw, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results='asis'}
breaks  <-  c(0,0.25,1,Inf) # Weighted scale

df <- dfa1$wi    # Data frame 1
freq1 <- fn_freqw(df, breaks, right=FALSE)

df <- dfa2$wi    # Data frame 2
freq2 <- fn_freqw(df, breaks, right=FALSE)

# Merging the two data sets (as example) 
freqw <- cbind(freq1, freq2)
```
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
kable(freqw, format = "html", caption = "Percentage frequencies of weights (wi) based on a weighted scale classification")

```

## fn_fyield()

`fn_fyield()`:	Calculates the fillet yield by dividing a defined weight reference
point **bm** by the mean, lower, and upper confidence interval of 95% (IC95%) of
the estimated fillet weight, respectively.

## fn_intervals()

`fn_intervals()`:	Calculates a non-parametric confidence and predicted intervals 
using the function predFit() from the package investr (version 1.4.2).

## fn_R2RV()

`fn_R2RV()`:	Calculates a robust version of the coefficient of determination
$R^{2}_{RV}$ (Renaud & Victoria-Feser, 2010).

## fn_summary()
`fn_summary()`:	Customizes and stores the summary of each fitted regression.

## fn_Wlive()
`fn_Wlive()`: The live weight, which is the total weight of an organism, is estimated based
on the weights of different landing categories, such as eviscerated weight and
fillet weight. These estimates are derived using regression parameters that
relate total weight to the weight of each landing category.

## fn_xseq() 
 
`fn_xseq()`:	Generates a data frame with a sequence for independent variables 
(including minimum and maximum values) and selects it according to the model.
