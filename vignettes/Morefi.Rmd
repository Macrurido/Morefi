# Morefi: Morphological Relationships Fitted by Robust Regression

This is a methodological package developed in R for analyzing the submitted article:

Aguirre-Villaseñor, H., Morales-Bojórquez, E., Cisneros-Mata (FISH13711). Biometric
relationships as a fisheries management tool: A case study of the bullseye puffer
(*Sphoeroides annulatus*. Tetraodontidae). Fisheries Research.

In fisheries monitoring, body length is the most commonly measured parameter because
it is quick and easy to obtain. In contrast, measuring weight requires a level 
and stable scale, which can be difficult to secure in field sampling. Biometric
relationships are crucial in fisheries biology. When accurately calculated, 
these relationships can be very useful for management purposes, especially for 
estimating an organism's total length or weight based on other body measurements.

Many species are marketed through artisanal fishing in various commercial forms.
However, there are currently no biometric relationships that allow for predicting
live weight (the total weight of the fish) from the different categories of landed
weight, such as fillet weight, gutted weight, or frozen weight.

The objective of this package is to provide quantitative models for various 
morphological relationships that help predict: a) the expected live weight of
different landed weight categories, b) the expected fillet yield from various 
commercial presentations, and c) testing the suitability of fillet yield as a 
reference point in managing the target species.

For this purpose, some functions and a vignette were created to explain the process
step by step. Its implementation streamlines the methodology and enhances the 
clarity and impact of both the results and graphical presentations (tables and 
figures are personalized).

The functions included in the Morefi package enable the
evaluation of length-length, weight-weight and length-weight
biometric relationships using data that exhibit high
variability and do not meet the assumptions necessary for
adjustment via 
least squares. Given this variability, a robust regression method is employed 
for analysis. The "robustbase" package (version 0.99-2) was utilized to fit 
robust regression models, using the functions lmrob() for linear and nlrob()
for non-linear regression (Maechler et al., 2024).

# Installation

You can install the development version of Morefi from [GitHub](https://github.com/Macrurido/Morefi.git) 
using one of the following options:

Using the **pak** package
``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("Macrurido/Morefi")
```
or using the **devtools** package

``` r
library(devtools)
install_github("Macrurido/Morefi")
```
# Data available in the package{.tabset}
## Bullseye puffer measures

To demonstrate how the package functions, we utilize the dataset `botete`,
containing 1,397 fish across 7 variables: the total length(LT), standard length
(SL), body trunk length (LB), total weight (WT), body trunk weight (WB), and 
fillet weight (Wfi) of the bullseye puffer (*Sphoeroides annulatus*), collected 
from the Eastern Central Pacific. In this dataset, the landing category is 
included in the "Fleet" variable, which is categorized as follows: 1 indicates 
Fresh, while 2 denotes Frozen-thawed. 

To access the data file, the data frame is stored in an object, such as 'mydata'.

```{r mydata, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
mydata <- Morefi::Botete
str(mydata)
```

## Bullseye puffer fish landings

A second dataset `Botete_land`, provided the Mexican fishing records of bullseye
puffer landed on the Pacific coast in 2023 and their live weight corresponding
live weight for each weight category (kg): total (WT), body trunk (WB) or fillet
(Wfi), either Fresh or Frozen-thawed (SIPESCA, 2024).

To access the data file, the data frame is stored in `catch`.

```{r catch, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
catch <- Morefi::Botete_land
catch
```

# Lists and tables to organize and store results.

## Defining the models

Eight relationships are fitted, six to a simple linear model: LT vs LS, LT vs LB,
LS vs LB, WT vs WB, WT vs Wfi, WB vs Wfi; and three to a potential model:
LT vs WT, LT vs WB, LT vs Wfi.

To perform each regression, a list named `modelos` is created to specify the 
variables that will be included. These variables are then stored in a vector.

```{r modelos, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results="hide"}
modelos <- list (LTvs.LS  =  c(1,2),
                 LTvs.LB  =  c(1,3),
                 LSvs.LB  =  c(2,3),
                 WTvs.WB  =  c(4,5),
                 WTvs.Wfi =  c(4,6),
                 WBvs.Wfi =  c(5,6),
                 LTvs.WT  =  c(1,4),
                 LTvs.WB  =  c(1,5),
                 LTvs.Wfi =  c(1,6))
```

## List to store regression results

To store the regression results, a nested list is created. This structure enables
a hierarchical or multi-level organization of data. At the first level, the data
sets are categorized as Fresh, Frozen-thawed (Frozen), and Total sample (Total).
At the second level, which consists of sub-lists, the results from the various
fitted models are presented.

```{r Results_lists, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results="hide"}
# A list that includes every model
X_list <- vector(mode='list', length=length(modelos))

# First hierarchical level
          Fresh <- X_list
          Frozen <- X_list
          Total <- X_list
          
# Second hierarchical level          
          List_master <- list(Fresh,Frozen,Total) # Master list
          List_fit <- List_master # To store fitting results
          List_ICmodels <- List_master # To store the confidence interval model 
```

## List_Tables store regression results

To store the results of each fitted model, a list called `List_Tables` was created.
Each item in the list contains the customized table `T1`, which is initially 
filled with `NA` values.

```{r List_Tables, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Create model list including empty T1 table
List_Tables <- setNames(lapply(1:length(modelos), function(x)
T1),names(modelos))
```

## Coincident Curves Test Table. 

List_TCCT store the values and calculus for the Coincident Curves Test

To store the results of each model regressions, an empty matrix of 4 rows and 8 
columns are created. The table `CCT` stores the values and calculus for the 
Coincident Curves Test between weight categories: **Fresh**, **Frozen**, 
**Total** and **Joined** (sum of values of **Fresh**, **Frozen**): the residual
sum of squares **RSS**, degree of freedom **DF**, Analysis of the Residual Sum 
of Squares **ARSS**,  **F-table**, **p-value** and decision criteria for 
$\alpha$= 0.05 **Criteria**. 

To store the results of each fitted model, a list called `List_TCCT` was created.
Each item in the list contains the customized table `CCT`, which is initially 
filled with `NA` values.

```{r List_TCCT, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results="hide"}
             
CCT <- (matrix(NA,nrow=4,ncol=8))
CCT[,2] <-  c("Fresh","Frozen","Total","Joined")
colnames(CCT) <- c("Model","Data","RSS","DF","ARSS","F-table",
                   "p-value","Criteria")

# Create model list including empty T1 table
List_TCCT <- setNames(lapply(1:length(modelos), function(x)
CCT),names(modelos))

CCT
```

## Confidence intervals

To save the confidence intervals of the predicted values for each landing category,
a list is created containing the sequences of these categories. The list, called
`List_x_seq`, is designed to define a vector for the independent variable (x), which
includes the full range of total length (**LT**), total weight (**WT**), and trunk
weight (**WB**), respectively.

```{r}
# Create a list to store each xseq sequence
          List_x_seq <- list(LT= seq(5,45,by=1),LS= seq(5,40,by=1),
                             WT= seq(50,2250,by=10), WB= seq(0,1000,by=10))
```

## Weighted frequencies

To store the Weighted frequencies an empty data frame is created. The class range
is indicated as the title of each column. The right-hand column, titled **1**,
indicates the number of weights equal to 1. The frequencies are stored by row for 
each model. In the first column, the models are indicated.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results="hide"}

wbks <- rep(c("Outliers",	"Weighted",	"Unweighted"),3)

wfrec <- data.frame(matrix(NA,nrow= length(modelos),
                           ncol =length(wbks) ))
wfrec <- cbind(X_names,wfrec)
colnames(wfrec)<- c("Models",wbks)

wfrec
```

# Fitting models





```{r , warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

```






# Establishing values for the examples provided.

Below is a unified set of objects that will be used in the function
examples to prevent the need for defining them in
each example.

# Graphing Functions Attributes{.tabset}

Moresi's graphing functions accept the same arguments. The data frame is created
based on the results from the previously defined fitting model. Below, you will
find the definitions for the color palette, opacity (transparency), regression name,
order for the multi-panel plot, the labels, and categorizing residual values.

## Data for the plots

## DF PARA las fn graficas 
Definimg values in common for the fn1, fn2 and fn3

<!-- df, opacity,tint, scale= wi_scale, order= X_names, my_labeller -->

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
# No esta hecho tengo que hacer el ajuste arriba para obtener valores de ahi, si no lo tndría que hacer en cada caso, Otra es hacer un archivo
#df <- List_dfa_long[[j]]
#df$id <- as.factor(df$id)
#df$scale <- as.factor(df$scale)

#df <- #######FALTA
```  


## Color palette

For figures representing morphometric relationships with residual color on a weighted
scale, the color palette was defined as `tint`. The transparency level (alpha) was
determined within the `opacity` object.

```{r tint, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
tint <- c("#000000", "#009E73", "#56B4E9")
opacity <- 0.7
```

## Regression name and order

The object `X_names` is created to define the names of the regression analyses 
and the order of composite graphs.

```{r X_names, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
X_names <- c("LT_LS", "LT_LB", "LS_LB",
             "WT_WB", "WT_Wfi", "WB_Wfi",
             "LT_WT", "LT_WB", "LT_Wfi")
```

## Model Labelers

The Morefi graphic functions support subscript letters in axis labels. Customized 
plot labels are stored in the variable `my_labeller`, utilizing the
`ggplot2::label_parsed()` function.

```{r my_labeller, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)

my_labeller <- as_labeller(c(LT_LS=  "L[T]-L[S]",
                             LT_LB=  "L[T]-L[B]",
                             LS_LB=  "L[S]-L[B]",
                             WT_WB=  "W[T]-W[B]",
                             WT_Wfi= "W[T]-W[fi]",
                             WB_Wfi= "W[B]-W[fi]",
                             LT_WT=  "L[T]-W[T]",
                             LT_WB=  "L[T]-W[B]",
                             LT_Wfi= "L[T]-W[fi]"),
                           default = label_parsed)
```

## Varible labelers

For the variable labelers, the variables include subscripts, and the customized
labels for the plots are stored in the variable `my_labeller`.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

my_labeller2 <- as_labeller(c(LT=  "L[T]",
                             LS=  "L[S]",
                             LB=  "L[B]",
                             WT=  "W[T]x",
                             WB=  "W[B]",
                             Wfi= "W[fi]"),
                             default = label_parsed)
```

## Categorizing residual values

The object `wi_scale` was defined to categorize the residual values of each regression based on the weighted value scale. It was used for plotting and analysis.

```{r wi_scale, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
wi_scale <- c(0.000, 0.249, 0.990, 1.000)
```

# Morefi functions

The Morefi package includes functions that facilitate data analysis and ensure 
reproducibility of results.

## fn_ARSS

The function `fn_ARSS` perform the Coincident Curves Test, to determine if there
are significant differences between the fitted curves for each database. It is 
based on the Analysis of the Residual Sum of Squares (ARSS) (Chen et al. 1992).


$$F=\frac{\frac{RSS_{p}-RSS_{s}}{3\bullet \left( K-1 \right)}}{\frac{RSS_{s}}{N-3\bullet K}}$$

$RSS_{p}= RSS$ of each regression fitted by pooled data, $RSS_{s}$= sum of the 
$RSS$ of each regression fitted for each individual sample, $N$= total sample 
size, and $K$ = number of samples in the comparison.

The residual sum of squares $RSS$ and the degrees of freedom $DF$ for each 
fitted regression are previously stored in the `List_TCCT` list. For each 
regression, the calculations are stored in a data frame `T1`, which is stored
iteratively using a loop for in a list `T`.

Inside the function, the RSS and DF for the joined sample are calculated to 
perform the F test for two tails $\alpha/2$. The decision criteria is performed:
"*" if $p-value\le \alpha$ or "NS" if the $p-val\gt \alpha$.

The function requires defining:

 * `List_TCCT`: A list with fitted regression results.  
 * `i`:  An integer value indicating the ith regression analyzed.
 * `alfa`: A numerical value that defines the significance level. The default number is 0.05.

The function return a data frame containing the results of the 
Coincident Curves Test stored in a list.

### Examples

The Total length (LT) - Total weight (WT) was estimated for the bullseye puffer
*Sphoeroides annulatus* for landed categories: Fresh, Frozen-thawed (Frozen), Total
(All sample) and Joined (sum of values of Fresh and Frozen). The Residual Sum of
Squares (RSS) and the degrees of freedom (DF) are provided for each data source.
In the table the first row displays the Analysis of Residual Sum of Squares (ARSS),
the p-value (p), and the decision criteria for the ARSS test (Criteria). 

The adjusted models show the following data: Fresh SSR=   and DF= 742; Frozen 
SSR= 1280131.81 and DF= 651; and the total sample SSR= 6115874.53 and DF= 1395.
Values are stored in the table `Table_CC`, this is stored in a list, and the name
of each item is built with the acronyms of the model variables (e.g. LTWT).

```{r fn_ARSS, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results='asis'}
Table_CC <- data.frame(matrix(NA,nrow=4,ncol=8))
Table_CC[1,1] <- "Lt-WT" 
Table_CC[,2] <- c("Fresh","Frozen","Total","Joined")
colnames(Table_CC) <- c("Model","Category","RSS","DF","ARSS","F-table","p-value","Criteria")

Table_CC[1,3] <- 4424418.33
Table_CC[1,4] <-  742 
Table_CC[2,3] <- 1280131.81
Table_CC[2,4] <-  651 
Table_CC[3,3] <- 6115874.53
Table_CC[3,4] <-  1395 

List_ARSS <- list(LTWT=Table_CC)

i <- 1

ARSS <- fn_ARSS(List_ARSS, i,  alfa= 0.05)

```

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(knitr)
kable(ARSS[[i]], format = "html", caption = "Table of the Coincident Curve Test.")
```

## fn_dfa

This function uses the `augment()` function from the `broom` package
to extract the observed values of the independent variable (x) and dependent
variable (y), along with the weights (wi), fitted values (fitt), and residuals
(ei) from the summary of the fitted model. It then turns these components
into tidy tibbles.

The function `augment()` does not provide the weights column for the `lmrob()`
function. The function `fn_dfa()` contains a conditional statement that
includes this variable in the output data frame of the linear adjustments.

In order to homogenizes the results, the columns names were renamed as "y",
"wi","x","fitt",and "ei".

An additional column has been included that codes errors using a scale based
on weighted values: unweighted (u), weighted (w), and outliers (o)
`dfa$scale <- ifelse(df$wi < 0.25, "o", ifelse(df$wi<1, "w", "u"))`.

The function requires defining:

 * `eq`: Summary of the equation fitted.  
 
### Examples

For the bullseye puffer *Sphoeroides annulatus*, the length-weight relationship
is modeled using the `robustbase::nlm` function, with an ordinate input value of
a = 0.1 and a slope of b = 3. The data frame `mydata` is sourced from the
Morefi::botete package.

```{r fn_dfa, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results='asis'}
df <- mydata[,c(1,4)]
colnames(df) <- c("x1", "y1")

a=0.01
b=3

eq <- robustbase::nlrob(y1 ~ a*x1^b, data= df,
                        start = list(a= a, b= b),
                        trace = FALSE)

dfa <- fn_dfa(eq)
```

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
kable(dfa[1:6,], format = "html", caption = "The initial six rows of the table are displayed.")
```


<!-- ### fn_fig_cs -->

<!-- This function creates an individual plot displaying the fitted model -->
<!-- alongside the observed values, which are colored according to a weighted color scale. -->

<!-- The function requires defining: -->

<!--  * `df` A data frame contains the following variables: independent (x) and dependent (y) variables, the fitted variable (fitt), a weighted variable (wi), and additional details including the weights (wi), fitted values (fitt), residuals (ei), and the scale.  -->
<!--  * `opacity` A numeric value for the alpha aesthetic used to control the transparency of elements in a plot. -->

<!--  * `etiquetas` A list indicating the labels of the axes and their unit of measurement. -->
<!--  * `modelos` A list of variables that are used for the regression model. -->
<!--  * `i` An integer value indicating the regression analyzed. -->

<!-- The function return an individual plots for fitted models with a point color scale. -->

## fn_fig_e

The function creates a graph that displays residuals on the vertical axis and 
either the independent variable or predicted values on the horizontal axis, as
determined by the researcher. The residuals are color-coded using a weighted scale.

The function returns a customized multi-panel residual plot that uses a color scale for the residual points.

Since the parameters contain subscripts, the labels were customized 
using the `ggplot2::as_labeller()` function and are stored in
`my_labeller`.

The function requires defining:

 * `df` A data frame contains the following variables: independent (x) and dependent (y) variables, the fitted variable (fitt), a weighted variable (wi), and additional details including the weights (wi), fitted values (fitt), residuals (ei), and the scale.
 * `opacity` A numeric value for the alpha aesthetic used to control the transparency of elements in a plot.
 * `tint` A vector that specifies the palette colors used to color the points.
 * `scale` A numeric vector that defines the thresholds for coloring the points.
 * `order` A vector determines the sequence of the plots.
 * `my_labeller` Transforms objects to labeller functions. Used internally by labeller().

### Example

A residual analysis of the model fitting has been conducted using
combined data sets for the pufferfish *Sphoeroides annulatus*. The
label in the grey box indicates the variables used for each model; the
first variable listed is the independent variable, and the second is
the dependent variable. The x-axis represents the values of the
independent variable, while the y-axis displays the raw residuals (ei).

The observed data points were coloured based on a weighted scale
$(w_{i})$: blue for unweighted $(w_{i}=1)$, green for weighted
(1>𝑤𝑖≥0.25), and black for outliers (𝑤𝑖<0.25). Lengths in cm and
weights in g.

The attributes associated with this function: `df`, `opacity`, `tint`, `wi_scale`, `X_names`, and `my_labeller` were previously defined in the section titled **Establishing Values for the Examples Provided.**

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
#df <- List_fit[[j]]
#df$id <- as.factor(df$id)
#df$scale <- as.factor(df$scale)

#df <- df

#p <- fn_fig_e(df, opacity, tint, scale= wi_scale,
# order= X_names, my_labeller)

```

## fn_fig_fw
<!-- Ok si la uso en el papiro, los argumentos son los mismos para la funcion anterior -->

`fn_fig_fw`: The fitted values of the models for a landed presentation category were
displayed as a multi-panel plot. The observed data points for each fitted 
relationship were categorized according to a weighted color scale.


The attributes associated with this function: `df`, `opacity`, `tint`, `wi_scale`, `X_names`, and `my_labeller` were previously defined in the section titled **Establishing Values for the Examples Provided.**

```{r}

#df <- list_rbind(List_fit[[3]], names_to = "id")

#p <- fn_fig_fw(df, opacity, tint, scale= wi_scale, order= X_names, my_labeller)
```


## fn_fig_w

<!-- Ok si la uso en el papiro, los argumentos son los mismos para la funcion anterior -->

`fn_fig_w`: The residual structure was analyzed by graphing  
residuals against weighted values. A custom multi-panel plot
illustrates the structure of each fitted relationship,
categorized by a color-weighted scale of values.

### Example

A residual analysis of the model fitting has been conducted using
combined data sets for the pufferfish *Sphoeroides annulatus*. The
label in the grey box indicates the variables used for each model; the raw residuals are shown on the x-axis, and the weighted residuals (wi) are displayed on the y-axis.

The observed data points were coloured based on a weighted scale
$(w_{i})$: blue for unweighted $(w_{i}=1)$, green for weighted
(1>𝑤𝑖≥0.25), and black for outliers (𝑤𝑖<0.25). Lengths in cm and
weights in g.

The attributes associated with this function: `df`, `opacity`, `tint`, `wi_scale`, `X_names`, and `my_labeller` were previously defined in the section titled **Establishing Values for the Examples Provided.**

```{r}
#j <-  3 # A numeric value specifies the data set that will be used.
#df <- List_fit[[j]]
#df$id <- as.factor(df$id)
#df$scale <- as.factor(df$scale)

# Plot of Residual Structures Classified by a Weighted Scale.
#p <- fn_fig_w(df, opacity,tint, my_labeller,order= X_names) 
```
