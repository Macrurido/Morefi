## Morefi

The *Morefi* package: *Morphological Relationships Fitted by Robust Regression*.
It is a methodological package developed in R to analyze the submitted article:

Aguirre-Villaseñor, H., Morales-Bojórquez, E., Cisneros-Mata (FISH13711). Biometric
relationships as a fisheries management tool: A case study of the bullseye puffer
(*Sphoeroides annulatus*. Tetraodontidae). Fisheries Research.

In fisheries monitoring, body length is the most commonly measured parameter because
it is quick and easy to obtain. In contrast, measuring weight requires a level 
and stable scale, which can be difficult to secure in field sampling. Biometric
relationships are crucial in fisheries biology. When accurately calculated, 
these relationships can be very useful for management purposes, especially for 
estimating an organism's total length or weight based on other body measurements.

Many species are marketed through artisanal fishing in various commercial forms.
However, there are currently no biometric relationships that allow for predicting
live weight (the total weight of the fish) from the different categories of landed
weight, such as fillet weight, gutted weight, or frozen weight.

The objective of this package is to provide quantitative models for various 
morphological relationships that help predict: a) the expected live weight of
different landed weight categories, b) the expected fillet yield from various 
commercial presentations, and c) testing the suitability of fillet yield as a 
reference point in managing the target species.

For this purpose, some functions and a vignette were created to explain the process
step by step. Its implementation streamlines the methodology and enhances the 
clarity and impact of both the results and graphical presentations (tables and 
figures are personalized).

The functions included in the Morefi package enable the
evaluation of length-length, weight-weight and length-weight
biometric relationships using data that exhibit high
variability and do not meet the assumptions necessary for
adjustment via 
least squares. Given this variability, a robust regression method is employed 
for analysis. The "robustbase" package (version 0.99-2) was utilized to fit 
robust regression models, using the functions lmrob() for linear and nlrob()
for non-linear regression (Maechler et al., 2024).

## Installation

You can install the development version of Morefi from [GitHub](https://github.com/Macrurido/Morefi.git) 
using one of the following options:

Using the **pak** package
``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("Macrurido/Morefi")
```
or using the **devtools** package

``` r
library(devtools)
install_github("Macrurido/Morefi")
```
## Data available in the package

### Bullseye puffer measures

To demonstrate how the package functions, we utilize the dataset `botete`,
containing 1,397 fish across 7 variables: the total length(LT), standard length
(SL), body trunk length (LB), total weight (WT), body trunk weight (WB), and 
fillet weight (Wfi) of the bullseye puffer (*Sphoeroides annulatus*), collected 
from the Eastern Central Pacific. In this dataset, the landing category is 
included in the "Fleet" variable, which is categorized as follows: 1 indicates 
Fresh, while 2 denotes Frozen-thawed. 

To access the data file, the data frame is stored in an object, such as 'mydata'.

```{r}
mydata <- Morefi::Botete
```

### Bullseye puffer fish landings

A second dataset `Botete_land`, provided the Mexican fishing records of bullseye
puffer landed on the Pacific coast in 2023 and their live weight corresponding
live weight for each weight category (kg): total (WT), body trunk (WB) or fillet
(Wfi), either Fresh or Frozen-thawed (SIPESCA, 2024).

To access the data file, the data frame is stored in `catch`.

```{r}
catch <- Morefi::Botete_land
```

## Morefi functions

The Morefi package includes functions that facilitate data analysis and ensure 
reproducibility of results.

### fn_ARSS

The function `fn_ARSS` perform the Coincident Curves Test, to determine if there
are significant differences between the fitted curves for each database. It is 
based on the Analysis of the Residual Sum of Squares (ARSS) (Chen et al. 1992).


$$F=\frac{\frac{RSS_{p}-RSS_{s}}{3\bullet \left( K-1 \right)}}{\frac{RSS_{s}}{N-3\bullet K}}$$

$RSS_{p}= RSS$ of each regression fitted by pooled data, $RSS_{s}$= sum of the 
$RSS$ of each regression fitted for each individual sample, $N$= total sample 
size, and $K$ = number of samples in the comparison.

The residual sum of squares $RSS$ and the degrees of freedom $DF$ for each 
fitted regression are previously stored in the `List_TCCT` list. For each 
regression, the calculations are stored in a data frame `T1`, which is stored
iteratively using a loop for in a list `T`.

Inside the function, the RSS and DF for the joined sample are calculated to 
perform the F test for two tails $\alpha/2$. The decision criteria is performed:
"*" if $p-value\le \alpha$ or "NS" if the $p-val\gt \alpha$.

The function requires defining:

 * `List_TCCT`: A list with fitted regression results.  
 * `i`:  An integer value indicating the ith regression analyzed.
 * `alfa`: A numerical value that defines the significance level. The default number is 0.05.

#### Examples

The Total length (LT) - Total weight (WT) was estimated for the bullseye puffer
*Sphoeroides annulatus* for landed categories: Fresh, Frozen-thawed (Frozen), Total
(All sample) and Joined (sum of values of Fresh and Frozen). The Residual Sum of
Squares (RSS) and the degrees of freedom (DF) are provided for each data source.
In the table the first row displays the Analysis of Residual Sum of Squares (ARSS),
the p-value (p), and the decision criteria for the ARSS test (Criteria). 

The adjusted models show the following data: Fresh SSR=   and DF= 742; Frozen 
SSR= 1280131.81 and DF= 651; and the total sample SSR= 6115874.53 and DF= 1395.
Values are stored in the table `Table_CC`, this is stored in a list, and the name
of each item is built with the acronyms of the model variables (e.g. LTWT).

```{r fn_ARSS, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results='asis'}
Table_CC <- data.frame(matrix(NA,nrow=4,ncol=8))
Table_CC[1,1] <- "Lt-WT" 
Table_CC[,2] <- c("Fresh","Frozen","Total","Joined")
colnames(Table_CC) <- c("Model","Category","RSS","DF","ARSS","F-table","p-value","Criteria")

Table_CC[1,3] <- 4424418.33
Table_CC[1,4] <-  742 
Table_CC[2,3] <- 1280131.81
Table_CC[2,4] <-  651 
Table_CC[3,3] <- 6115874.53
Table_CC[3,4] <-  1395 

List_ARSS <- list(LTWT=Table_CC)

i <- 1

ARSS <- fn_ARSS(List_ARSS, i,  alfa= 0.05)

```
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(knitr)
kable(ARSS[[i]], format = "html", caption = "Table of the Coincident Curve Test.")
```



### fn_dfa

This function uses the `augment()` function from the `broom` package
to extract the observed values of the independent variable (x) and dependent
variable (y), along with the weights (wi), fitted values (fitt), and residuals
(ei) from the summary of the fitted model. It then turns these components
into tidy tibbles.

The function `augment()` does not provide the weights column for the `lmrob()`
function. The function `fn_dfa()` contains a conditional statement that
includes this variable in the output data frame of the linear adjustments.

In order to homogenizes the results, the columns names were renamed as "y",
"wi","x","fitt",and "ei".

An additional column has been included that codes errors using a scale based
on weighted values: unweighted (u), weighted (w), and outliers (o)
`dfa$scale <- ifelse(df$wi < 0.25, "o", ifelse(df$wi<1, "w", "u"))`.

The function requires defining:

 * `eq`: Summary of the equation fitted.  

#### Examples

For the bullseye puffer *Sphoeroides annulatus*, the length-weight relationship
is modeled using the `robustbase::nlm` function, with an ordinate input value of
a = 0.1 and a slope of b = 3. The data frame `mydata` is sourced from the
Morefi::botete package.

```{r r fn_dfa, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results='asis'}
df <- mydata[,c(1,4)]
colnames(df) <- c("x1", "y1")

a=0.01
b=3

eq <- robustbase::nlrob(y1 ~ a*x1^b, data= df,
                        start = list(a= a, b= b),
                        trace = FALSE)

dfa <- fn_dfa(eq)
```

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
kable(dfa[1:6,], format = "html", caption = "The initial six rows of the table are displayed.")
```




`fn_dfa`: 

`fn_fig_cs`: This function creates an individual plot displaying the fitted model
alongside the observed values, which are colored according to a weighted color scale.

`fn_fig_e`: The function creates a graph that displays residuals on the vertical axis
and either the independent variable or predicted values on the horizontal
axis, as determined by the researcher. The residuals are color-coded using
a weighted scale.

`fn_fig_fw`: The fitted values of the models for a landed presentation category were
displayed as a multi-panel plot. The observed data points for each fitted 
relationship were categorized according to a weighted color scale.

`fn_fig_w`: The residual structure was analyzed by graphing  
residuals against weighted values. A custom multi-panel plot
illustrates the structure of each fitted relationship,
categorized by a color-weighted scale of values.

`fn_figs`:	Creates a customized scatter plot with the observed values (points),
fitted regression (solid line), and its confidence interval (shaded area).

`fn_freq`:	The function calculates a frequency distribution of data.

`fn_freqw`	This is a methodological function to calculate the percentage 
frequencies of weights by model adjusted using the robust regression approach.

`fn_fyield`:	Calculates the fillet yield by dividing a defined weight reference
point **bm** by the mean, lower, and upper confidence interval of 95% (IC95%) of
the estimated fillet weight, respectively.

`fn_intervals`:	Calculates a non-parametric confidence and predicted intervals 
using the function predFit() from the package investr (version 1.4.2).

`fn_R2RV`:	Calculates a robust version of the coefficient of determination
$R^{2}_{RV}$ (Renaud & Victoria-Feser, 2010).

`fn_summary`:	Customizes and stores the summary of each fitted regression.

`fn_Wlive`: The live weight, which is the total weight of an organism, is estimated based
on the weights of different landing categories, such as eviscerated weight and
fillet weight. These estimates are derived using regression parameters that
relate total weight to the weight of each landing category.

`fn_xseq`:	Generates a data frame with a sequence for independent variables 
(including minimum and maximum values) and selects it according to the model.
