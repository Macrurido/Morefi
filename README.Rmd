## Morefi

The *Morefi* package: *Morphological Relationships Fitted by Robust Regression*.
It is a methodological package developed in R to analyze the submitted article:

Aguirre-Villaseñor, H., Morales-Bojórquez, E., Cisneros-Mata (FISH13711).Biometric
relationships as a fisheries management tool: A case study of the bullseye puffer
(*Sphoeroides annulatus*. Tetraodontidae). Fisheries Research.

In fisheries monitoring, body length is the most commonly measured parameter because
it is quick and easy to obtain. In contrast, measuring weight requires a level 
and stable scale, which can be difficult to secure in field sampling. Biometric
relationships are crucial in fisheries biology. When accurately calculated, 
these relationships can be very useful for management purposes, especially for 
estimating an organism's total length or weight based on other body measurements.

Many species are marketed through artisanal fishing in various commercial forms.
However, there are currently no biometric relationships that allow for predicting
live weight (the total weight of the fish) from the different categories of landed
weight, such as fillet weight, gutted weight, or frozen weight.

The objective of this package is to provide quantitative models for various 
morphological relationships that help predict: a) the expected live weight of
different landed weight categories, b) the expected fillet yield from various 
commercial presentations, and c) testing the suitability of fillet yield as a 
reference point in managing the target species.

For this purpose, some functions and a vignette were created to explain the process
step by step. Its implementation streamlines the methodology and enhances the 
clarity and impact of both the results and graphical presentations (tables and 
figures are personalized).

The functions included in the Morefi package enable the evaluation of length-length,
weight-weight and length-weight biometric relationships using data that exhibit
high variability and do not meet the assumptions necessary for adjustment via 
least squares. Given this variability, a robust regression method is employed 
for analysis. The "robustbase" package (version 0.99-2) was utilized to fit 
robust regression models, using the functions lmrob() for linear and nlrob()
for non-linear regression (Maechler et al., 2024).

## Installation

You can install the development version of Morefi from [GitHub](https://github.com/Macrurido/Morefi.git) 
using one of the following options:

Using the **pak** package
``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("Macrurido/Morefi")
```
or using the **devtools** package

``` r
library(devtools)
install_github("Macrurido/Morefi")
```
## Data available in the package

### Bullseye puffer measures: botete_measures.rda

To demonstrate how the package functions, we utilize the dataset `botete_measures.rda`,
containing 1,405 fish across 7 variables: the total length(LT), standard length 
(SL), body trunk length (LB), total weight (WT), body trunk weight (WB), and 
fillet weight (Wfi) of the bullseye puffer (*Sphoeroides annulatus*), collected 
from the Eastern Central Pacific. In this dataset, the landing category is 
included in the "Fleet" variable, which is categorized as follows: 1 indicates
Fresh, while 2 denotes Frozen-thawed. 

To access the data file, the data frame is stored in an object, such as 'catch'.

``` r
catch <- Morefi::Botete_land
```

### Bullseye puffer fish landings: botete_land.rda

A second dataset `Botete_land.rda`, provided the Mexican fishing records of bullseye
puffer landed on the Pacific coast in 2023 and their live weight corresponding
live weight for each weight category (kg): total (WT), body trunk (WB) or fillet
(Wfi), either Fresh or Frozen-thawed (SIPESCA, 2024).


To access the data file, the data frame is stored in `mydata`.
``` r
mydata <- Morefi::Botete
```
## Morefi functions

The Morefi package consists of nine functions designed to facilitate data analysis
and ensure that results can be reproduced.

`fn_ARSS`:	Perform the Coincident Curves Test, to determine if there are significant
differences between the fitted curves for each database. It is based on the 
Analysis of the Residual Sum of Squares (ARSS) (Chen et al., 1992).

`fn_dfa`: This function uses the `broom::augment()` function to extract observed
values, predictions, residuals, and weighted values from the fitted regression 
summary. An additional column has been added to code errors on a scale. It then 
transforms these components into tidy tibbles.

`fn_fig_cs`: This function creates an individual plot displaying the fitted model
alongside the observed values, which are colored according to a weighted color scale.

`fn_fig_e`: The function creates a graph that displays residuals on the vertical axis
and either the independent variable or predicted values on the horizontal
axis, as determined by the researcher. The residuals are color-coded using
a weighted scale.

`fn_fig_fw`: The fitted values of the models for a landed presentation category were
displayed as a multi-panel plot. The observed data points for each fitted 
relationship were categorized according to a weighted color scale.

`fn_fig_w`: The residual structure was analyzed by graphing standardized 
residuals against weighted values. A custom multi-panel plot illustrates the
structure of each fitted relationship, categorized by a color-weighted scale of values.

`fn_figs`:	Creates a customized scatter plot with the observed values (points),
fitted regression (solid line), and its confidence interval (shaded area).

`fn_freq`:	The function calculates a frequency distribution of data.

`fn_freqw`	This is a methodological function to calculate the percentage 
frequencies of weights by model adjusted using the robust regression approach.

`fn_fyield`:	Calculates the fillet yield by dividing a defined weight reference
point **bm** by the mean, lower, and upper confidence interval of 95% (IC95%) of
the estimated fillet weight, respectively.

`fn_intervals`:	Calculates a non-parametric confidence and predicted intervals 
using the function predFit() from the package investr (version 1.4.2).

`fn_R2RV`:	Calculates a robust version of the coefficient of determination
$R^{2}_{RV}$ (Renaud & Victoria-Feser, 2010).

`fn_summary`:	Customizes and stores the summary of each fitted regression.

`fn_Wlive`: The live weight, which is the total weight of an organism, is estimated based
on the weights of different landing categories, such as eviscerated weight and
fillet weight. These estimates are derived using regression parameters that
relate total weight to the weight of each landing category.

`fn_xseq`:	Generates a data frame with a sequence for independent variables 
(including minimum and maximum values) and selects it according to the model.

## More details

For more information, please refer to the respective vignettes, which offer 
detailed descriptions of each function, its operations, and examples.

## Example

outlined in the "Morefi_steps" vignette, which reconstructs the results presented
in the article by Aguirre-Villaseñor et al. (FISH13711).
